# **Inspiration**
Our team shares the belief that **journaling** is great for ones **mental health**. From stress relief, to self reflection, to improved ability to communicate and express ourselves - the benefits of journaling are incredible. As great as journaling is it can be very **hard for busy developers to remember to journal every day** - even if it would greatly **benefit their mental health**, so we wanted to develop a way to integrate into their workflow and keep them committed.

# **What it does**
**Termbook** is a complete journaling system to **keep developers on the journaling journey**. Each time you open your terminal - you will be prompted to enter a journal entry for the day (unless you already have). Our program will force you to write at least **50 words** so you can unburden and reflect. You can then use a **cloud based web app** to view all your **previous entries**. You can use the github account you use every day with our service! We have **fantastic docs** and **cross platform support** so no matter who you are, you can get started journaling with us.
