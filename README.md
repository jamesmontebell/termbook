# TermBook

## Inspiration
Our team agreed journaling makes us feel better. From stress relief, to self reflection, to improved ability to communicate and express ourselves - the benefits of journaling are endless. But it can be very hard for busy developers to remember to journal, even if it would greatly benefit their mental health. 

## What it does
Termbook is a complete journaling system to keep developers on the journaling journey. Each time you open your terminal - you will be prompted to enter a journal entry for the day (unless you already have). [Our cli program](https://github.com/idugan100/termbookbackend) will force you to write at least 50 words so you can unburden and reflect. This repo is for a cloud based web app to view all your previous entries. You can use the github account you use every day with our service! We have fantatic docs and cross platform support so no matter who you are, you can get started journaling with us.

## How we built it
This is a Next.js web app styled with tailwind for easy viewing of your past journal entries. The web application was built with full user authentication and authorization in mind, as well as protected API routes for more security.
